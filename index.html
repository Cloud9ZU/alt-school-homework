        <p>This is a meal I make when I want something flavorful on a cold day to go with a bottle of wine. I created this dish from scratch after watching a handful of Youtube videos about Chinese fried rice and wanting to infuse my own blend of <i><strong>NAIJA</strong></i> into the menu.</p>
        <p>Usually, the original chinese egg fried rice doesn't have a lot of ingredients but I wanted to make mine in a different way. The first day I made it for family, it became a staple and I keep getting requests to make it for internal parties.</p>
            <p>Most times, after making this, I sit and binge movies that have been on my watch list for a while. It is perfect for a quiet evening, a healthy brunch or even an addition to the potluck menu when hanging out with friends. You would definitely enjoy making this so let us get into it.</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the diced chicken breast in a bowl with onion and garlic powder, black pepper, a pinch of salt, 1 teaspoon of soy sauce, and a drizzle of olive oil. Mix well, cover, and set aside for 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Wash the rice until the water runs clear and drain it. Fry the rice for about 5 minutes in seasoned olive or coconut oil with minced garlic, ginger, stock cube, and scotch bonnet pepper. Pour in chicken broth until the liquid is just above the rice. Cook until the rice is 80% done, then set it aside to cool</li>
            <li>Whisk the eggs with a pinch of salt and a teaspoon of black pepper. Fry the mixture, scrambling the eggs so they don't clump together.</li>
            <li>In a large wok, fry the diced liver for about 5 minutes, then remove it. In the same oil, fry the marinated chicken until it is brown and tender, then remove it.</li>
            <li>Using the same oil, stir-fry the diced onion, minced garlic, ginger, and scotch bonnet pepper for about 3 minutes. Add the carrots, bell peppers, green peas, and sweet corn.Fry for 5 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the fried chicken and liver, leftover marinade, 2 stock cubes, chili flakes, and salt to the wok. Mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Pour in the cooked rice and toss until everything is properly mixed. Add the soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sesame oil, and fry for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Finally, add the scrambled eggs and diced spring onions. Mix on high heat for a bit, then turn off the fire.</li>

            <h2>Notes and Tips</h2>
             <ul>
            <li>The liver and cabbage are optional ingredients.</li>
            <li>You can use any combination of vegetables you prefer.</li>
            <li>If you are cooking from scratch (boiling the rice and cooking the chicken on the same day), the prep time will increase by 30 minutes. Using day-cooked rice and already cooked chicken broth will reduce the prep time.</li>
            <li>For extra crunch, you can add shredded cabbage while adding the eggs and spring onions.</li>
            <li>Coconut oil has a high smoke point, so you may want to use a lower heat setting when frying or use refined coconut oil.</li>
        </ul>
